# Expenses Tracker

**Expense Tracker** project is a personal finance management application designed to help users track their `income`, `expenses`, and `stock portfolio`.

### Features

Users can:

* **Record Transactions**: Log income and expense transactions, categorizing them and specifying the date and description. They can associate these transactions with different bank accounts.

* **Manage Multiple Accounts**: Track multiple bank accounts (checking, savings, etc.) and brokerage accounts. The application will maintain separate balances for each account.

* **View Transactions:** View a history of all transactions, filtered by account, date range, or category. Users can also see a combined view of transactions across all accounts of a certain type (e.g., all bank transactions, all brokerage transactions).

* **Manage Stock Portfolio**: Track their stock portfolio by recording buy and sell transactions. The application will calculate the current quantity of each stock owned and can provide an aggregated view of the entire portfolio.
View Stock Transactions: Review the history of stock purchases and sales for each brokerage account.

* **Get Stock Prices**: Fetch current stock prices from an external API.
User Authentication: Secure user accounts with registration and login functionality.

Essentially, it's a comprehensive tool to get a clear picture of a user's financial situation, including both banking activities and stock market investments.
